  This project will explore the Accidents dataset and try fit a Poisson, Negative Binomial, Mixture of 2 Poissons and zero inflated Poisson models to the data. The model with the strongest support will be chosen and discussed. Profile likelihoods and confidence intervals for the parameters will be found and displayed of the chosen model.

<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf. These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

#Introduction

This assignment is an explorative report on a dataset containing accident counts. The aim of the report is to find and fit a model which accurately describes the accident dataset. This report will first explore the data then fit different adequate distributions and choose the most appropriate one. Once a model has been selected the profile likelihood and confidence intervals will be programmed and calculated from from first principles. The results will then be analysed critically and conclusions will be made and consider further considerations in the study.

##Exploratory data analysis

To better understand our data this report shall explore the following properties; Firstly we examine the type of data within the accidents dataset and discuss whether our data is discrete ordinal or continuous. After the symmetry of the data and bounds will be discussed. This leads the exploration to outliers and extreme values.

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("data/accidents.csv") %>% 
  setNames(c("Index","Counts"))

#first column is just an index, second is a  1632 observations

#first visualise the data

firstplot <- ggplot(dat, aes(dat$Counts)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth= .5,
                 fill="blue",
                 alpha = .4,
                 position="dodge")+
  labs(x="Accident counts", y="Frequency") +
  labs(title="Histogram\n Accident counts") +
  theme_classic()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
  

firstbox <- ggplot(dat)+
  geom_boxplot(aes(y= dat$Counts,x=1),
               fill = "cornflowerblue", 
               outlier.color ="firebrick")+
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))+
  labs(title="Boxplot\n Accident counts") +
  labs(x="Accident counts",y ="")+
  coord_flip()

gridExtra::grid.arrange(firstplot,firstbox)

```

### Data type
The in our accident dataset we noticed that there are many observations that have zero accidents. This suggests that we should focus on distribution that are zero weighted. The accident counts are denoted as a frequency which intuitively is a discrete variable and can take on values greater than or equal
to zero. Thus accident counts will be regarded is a discrete positive definite random variable on the interval $R \in \{0;+ \infty\}$

### Symmerty
This property is visually seen in the histogram and boxplot displaying the accident data. All count are greater than zero with the majority of count being below 20. The largest accident count being 70. This shows that the data is non symetrical and positively skewed.

### Outliers
From the boxplot it clear that many outliers exist. An observation is termed an extreme value or outlier if it falls more than 1.5 times the inner-quartile range above the upper quartile. The proportion of outliers within our data set amount to 15.26% this give us reason to believe that population is also heavily skewed to the right. As aforementioned there are observations more extreme than what is displayed, which further reinforces our observation.

```{r}
#five number summary of the data
five_sum <- summary(dat)

#percentage outliers - 3rd quartile is 9
perc_outlier <- round(length(dat$Counts[dat$Counts > 1.5*9])/length(dat$Counts),4)*100
```


#Methods 

##Model Formulation

Since our data is discrete, asymmetric, positive definite, contains many positive outliers and zeros this would suggest distributions such as Poisson, Negative Binomial and mixture distributions such as 2 poisson and a zero inflated Poisson. 

###Poisson 

###Negative Binomial

###Mixture of 2 poissons

###Zero inflated Poisson

-We can use optimisers but we must program the likelihoods ourselves

##Model Selection

-Illustrate how good the model is 

-We need to reparameterize parameters so that they are unbounded

##Profile Likelihood & Confidence Intervals

-Plot likelihood surface (two parameters at a time if necessary, fixing the
other parameters at their MLEs).

-Must be program the profile likelihoods, CI's ourselves

#Results 

#Conclusion

-What are the next steps and how can we improve the models
